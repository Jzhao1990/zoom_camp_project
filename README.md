# 2025 Data Engineering Zoomcamp Final Project - Covid Data Analysis

## Overview

Coronavirus is a new word coming into everyoneâ€™s life since early 2020. Although the peak of the crisis has been over, I am curious about the impact to the state of Maryland. Therefore, for my final project for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp by DataTalks Club, I want to analyze the data to see county distribution and daily trends.

## Problem Description

A data pipeline in **Airflow** needs to be built that pulls in data daily from [DATA.GOV](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/md-covid-19-cases-by-county), ingests it by batch, and loads it into **Google Cloud Storage** (GCS) and then **BigQuery**.

- **Data Transformation**: The raw data will be transformed within **BigQuery**.
- **Visualization**: The data will be visualized using **Google Looker Studio**.

### Questions to be Answered

- How are the Covid-19 cases spread across counties in Maryland?
- What does the daily trend look like for the top 5 counties in Maryland?

## Technology Utilized

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Airflow
- **Data Lake**: Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- **Data Warehouse**: Google BigQuery
- **Visualization**: Google Looker Studio

## Pipeline

### Source:
Data to be loaded from the public dataset:  
[MD Covid-19 Cases by County - Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/md-covid-19-cases-by-county)

### Data Lake:
Data is stored in a data lake within a Google Cloud Storage bucket (GCS).

### Dataset:

- **Staging Dataset**: (Details on the staging dataset here)
- **Curated Dataset**: (Details on the curated dataset here)

### Data Transformation:
The raw data will be transformed within **BigQuery**.

### Orchestration:
An orchestrated data pipeline will be built in **Airflow** with a daily data refresh at **20:00:00 UTC**.

## Visualization

The dashboard can be found here:  
[Covid-19 Data Visualization - Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/0876bd1f-5d04-430c-9dd4-a4594d786d83/page/p_gv11gmiyqd)

**Disclaimer**: The dashboard will be updated until **June 21, 2025**, as my trial period on Google Cloud expires at that time.

## Future Work That Could Be Done

- **Reproducibility**: Ensure the pipeline is easily reproducible in other environments.
- **Implement CI/CD**: Set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment for automated testing and deployment.
- **DBT Transformation**: Implement **DBT** (Data Build Tool) for better data transformations.
